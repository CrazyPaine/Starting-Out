# Starting Out Again Reborn

This is be me coding and doing other things within this code.
In addition I will be doing a bit more with this code than normal.

Things to remember whenever I'm coding:
1.Being more uncomfortable with coding even when copying and pasting. But you can make it for you and change many things around. Take control and design it the way you like. Think of it as Myspace or Tumblr again.

2.Please stop adding so many fucking spaces in your code when the computer does the fucking work for you.

3.Please only add one space for each line of code. That's all you fucking need.

4.If you need to copy something then do so but get comfortable with creating something on your fucking own.

5.You can fucking do it bitch. Do not doubt yourself now, you came way too far, you got this. You are loved. You are worthy. You got fucking got this.

6.Always believe in yourself, no matter what happens.

More about the CODE:
This will be about my first project:

✅User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

✅User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

✅User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

✅User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

✅User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

✅User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

Gathering more information about Eartha Kitt, and typing everything I can think of while referencing.

User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
